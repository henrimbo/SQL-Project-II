SQL Queries (Big Query) 

The Chicago Taxi Trips Dataset is hosted on Google Cloud's BigQuery platform. It is a detailed compilation of taxi trips in the city of Chicago. 
I have analysed taxi trips, durations of the trips, companies, tolls, tips and others. These  queries will not only uncover trends and patterns within the Chicago 
taxi trip data also exemplifies the transformative power of cloud-based analytics in extracting meaningful insights from large datasets. 
The outcomes of this analysis will be particularly valuable for stakeholders in urban planning, transportation services, and economic research, 
providing a data-driven foundation for informed decision-making and strategic planning in urban mobility.
